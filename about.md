Here in CGS Coding Club, we are preparing for the AIO and other competitive programming competitions.

This website is aimed to provide easy access to contests and trainings, as well as the resources on the lesson topics. Some notes and recordings will also be placed here.

The website source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/cgs-coding-club/cgs-coding-club.github.io).
