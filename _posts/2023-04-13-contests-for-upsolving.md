title: Prerequisites for the competitive programming club
---

# Prerequisites

- A CodeForces account. You can create one [here](https://codeforces.com/register).
- An ORAC account. We will talk about the Australian Olympiad problems so you'll probably need one. Get yourself one [here](https://orac2.info/accounts/register/).
- An hour and a half after school. We are still discussing the schedule. We will put a Google Form here if there is a need for that.
- Curiosity and interest in competitive programming. No experience needed, if you know some mathematics and have a basic understanding of what coding is, this is certainly enough to get started. Any experience in the field is, of course, much appreciated - we will find the problems and theory that is interesting and useful for everyone.

# What is competitive programming? Is it about cybersecurity or robots?

Great question. In competitive programming, the competition participants are given a set of problems on different topics. Some of them involve logic, others use the knowledge of mathematics etc. The one thing is the same though - the solution is a piece of code that solves the problem on different data. The goal is to solve the most problems in limited time (usually several hours).

We're not going to cover neither cybersecurity nor practical programming, but the knowledge of algorithms and techniques studied will definitely help with Maths and Computer Science courses. It is also a way to meet lots of cool smart people all around the world.
